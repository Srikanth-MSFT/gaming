# What Is It?
The Gaming App Simulation Solution Accelerator is a ready-to-deploy reference implementation that showcases how to build a modern, global scale, intelligent gaming platform using Cosmos DB Core API.

# Overview
Modern gaming platforms demand:
- **Global availability**
- **Real-time responsiveness**
- **Massive scalability**
- **AI-driven personalization**

Azure Cosmos DB delivers these capabilities with:
- Multi-region writes
- Autoscale throughput
- Change Feed for event streaming
- Vector search for AI
- Field-level encryption
- RBAC and private endpoints

# Whatâ€™s Included?
Sample Gaming App schema and data with following collections
  players
  sessions
  leaderboards
  events
  matches
Database and collection provisioning with auto-scale throughput
Leaderboard bucketing and RU tracking
Data Seeding: Generate synthetic players across regions
Simulation: Concurrent gameplay across regions
Query: Retrieve top-K leaderboard results
Change Feed: Pull recent events for live ops

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Azure Cosmos DB Core API for Gaming Collections

This section demonstrates how to:
- Connect to Azure Cosmos DB Core (SQL) API
- Read sample documents from existing collections (`players`, `sessions`, `leaderboards`, `events`, `matches`)
- Generate embeddings using Azure OpenAI
- Store documents with embeddings in a new container with vector indexing
- Perform vector search queries for RAG scenarios

# Why Use This Accelerator?
- Try before you build: Explore Cosmos DB Core API capabilities in a sandboxed Azure environment
- Accelerate time-to-value: Use pre-built components to jumpstart your implementation
- Showcase to stakeholders: Demonstrate real-world use cases like instant scalability, ultra low latency, global replication, and intelligent assistants
